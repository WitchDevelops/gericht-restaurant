## Design 
Design from [ui8.net](https://ui8.net/iqonicdesign/products/gericht-restaurant-website-ui-in-figma)

## What I learned
How to use the form library [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/get-started) to display form errors for client-side form validation and use uncontrolled input. It was also a great opportunity to practice implementing CSS-only slider (image gallery) and get a better feel for using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations.
